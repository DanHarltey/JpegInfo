# JpegInfo

Reads header information from JPEGâ€™s such as, width & height dimensions (resolution). It only takes details from the jpeg headers. Making it fast, with low memory usage, because it does no image processing. 
Supports .Net standard 1.0 and above.

I wrote this because I needed to find out the resolution of lots of images. The only way I could find in .Net Core was to use a fully-fledged image processor that took up too much CPU and memory for the level of task.
